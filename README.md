This is a mini MERN project that includes MongoDB for the database, React for the frontend, and Node.js for the backend. The project allows for login and signup for both students and masters, and authorization for both using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It also includes state management using Redux for better performance and scalability.

## Features
   * Login and signup for both students and masters
   * Authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
   * State management using Redux
   * Masters can add tasks
   * Students can solve tasks and submit responses
   * Calculation algorithm used as per specified conditions
   * Handling authentication errors and other server errors

## Project Structure

  The project is organized into the following directories:

   * Client: contains the client-side React code
   * Server: contains the server-side Node.js code
   * models: contains MongoDB schema definitions
   * routes: contains the API routes for the server
   * controllers: contains the flow control logic files for the server

## Technologies Used

   * Mongoose:a Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB
   * Express: a web application framework for Node.js used for building APIs
   * React: a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
   * Node.js: a JavaScript runtime environment used for running the server-side code
   * Tailwind: a CSS framework used for styling the front-end components
   * Axios: Promise pased API communication with client and server
   * JWT:used to securely transfer information over the client and server
   * Helmet:set security-related HTTP response headers
